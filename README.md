# Writing Workers For Scalable Applications

## Simplest Example

Use `bin/start.php` to start a worker, then use `bin/add.php` to add jobs to the queue, watch the terminal with `start.php` running to see the jobs being processed.

Use `bin/stop.php <workerId>` to pass a command to the worker and tell it to stop.

Groovy.
